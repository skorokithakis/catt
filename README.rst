Cast All The Things allows you to send videos from many, many online sources
(YouTube, Vimeo, and a few hundred others) to your Chromecast. It also allows
you to cast local files.


Installation
------------

You can install Cast All The Things with pip::

    pip install catt

Usage
-----

To use Cast All The Things, just specify a URL::

    catt cast "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZMfhtKa-wo"

CATT supports any service that youtube-dl supports, which includes most online
video hosting services.

CATT can also cast local files (if they're in a format the Chromecast supports
natively)::

    catt cast ./myvideo.mp4

You can also control your Chromecast through ``catt`` commands, for example with
``catt pause``. Try running ``catt --help`` to see the full list of commands.

Configuration file
""""""""""""""""""

CATT can utilize a config-file stored at ``~/.config/catt/catt.cfg``

The format is as following::

    [options]
    device = chromecast_one
    
    [aliases]
    one = chromecast_one
    two = chromecast_two

In the ``[options]`` section, ``device`` denotes the default device that will 
be selected, when you have not selected a device via the cli.

You can write your choice of default device to ``catt.cfg`` by doing::

    catt -d <name_of_chromecast> write_config

In the ``[aliases]`` section, you can specify aliases for the names of your
chromecasts. You can then select a device just by doing::

    catt -d <alias> <command>

Currently, in order to take advantage of this functionality, you need to manually
edit ``catt.cfg``

Contributing
------------

If you want to contribute a feature to CATT, please open an issue (or comment on
an existing one) first, to make sure it's something that the maintainers are
interested in. Afterwards, just clone the repository and hack away!

To run CATT in development, you can use the following command::

    python -m catt.cli --help

Thanks!
